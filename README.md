**📘 Depression Detection from Social Media Text (Deep Learning Project)**

**By Gunti Adhithya**



This project aims to identify early signs of depression using social media posts with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. The model predicts whether a given text indicates depressive tendencies, enabling early intervention and mental-health monitoring.



**🔍 Project Overview**



Social media platforms contain large amounts of user-generated text that often reflects emotional states. In this project, I developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to detect depressive text patterns.



The workflow includes:



Data preprocessing \& cleaning



Tokenization and sequence padding



Model development using LSTM/BERT



Model training and evaluation



Explainable AI analysis using SHAP



Deployment-ready app code



This project demonstrates my skills in Python, Deep Learning, NLP, SQL data preparation, and model explainability.



**🧠 Technologies Used**



Python



TensorFlow / Keras



NumPy, Pandas



NLTK



Scikit-learn



Matplotlib / Seaborn



SHAP



SQL (for dataset preprocessing)

**📊 Model Features**



✔ Text cleaning \& normalization

✔ Tokenizer-based vectorization

✔ LSTM/BERT classification model

✔ Training, testing, validation accuracy \& loss

✔ SHAP-based explainability for interpreting predictions



**📈 Sample SQL Usage**



SQL queries were used during preprocessing to:



Store cleaned text



Filter depressive posts



Combine user metadata



Select text based on sentiment labels



**🚀 How to Run the Model**

pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/model\_training.py

python app/app.py



**📝 Result**



The model successfully classifies depressive vs non-depressive posts and provides explanations for predictions using SHAP. This project demonstrates my ability to build an end-to-end AI system using Python and Deep Learning.
